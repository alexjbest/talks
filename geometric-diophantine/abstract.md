Geometric approaches to solving Diophantine equations
=====================================================

A Diophantine equation is normally an equation in multiple unknowns with integer coefficients and often unknown powers. The study of these equations is generally classed as a topic within number theory, though common techniques for answering questions about them come from algebra and analysis.

Interesting questions one might ask given a Diophantine equation are, does it have any integer solutions? Any non-obvious ones? Does it have infinitely many?

In short we try and classify and possibly compute all solutions to a given equation.
Ideas and methods from geometry can provide surprising and remarkable answers to these questions. This talk will demonstrate a few such geometric techniques and also discuss their origins. I also hope to mention the modern ideas stemming from this sort of approach that have developed into a huge field known as arithmetic geometry.
