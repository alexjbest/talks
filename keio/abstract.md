Explicit computation with Coleman integrals
===========================================

Coleman integration is a $p$-adic integration theory that may be applied to integrate 1-forms on curves.
The applications of these integrals are varied, but include $p$-adic polylogarithms, explicit determination of rational points and torsion points on curves, and the computation of regulator maps.

We will discuss some methods to compute these integrals explicitly in practice, in a number of cases and the advantages of each approach for various applications.
We will also give some examples where explicit calculation of such integrals coupled with other techniques gives us theoretical results of interest.













Motivation
{
Introduction with motivation

Why do we integrate? 1-forms -> functions

logarithm maps turn translation invariant differentials into homomorphisms

regulators?

p-adic disks bad

why overconverge
}
Meat
{
In theory for CM -> regulator

Jacobian arithmetic, only trans invariant forms (Jacobian approach)

Besser-de Jeu (now in sage)

Pick a lift (BBK p-adic cohomology approach)

Connection to zeta functions
