A guided tour of Chabauty methods
---------------------------------

Chabauty's method is a p-adic technique for determining the set of rational points on a projective curve that can be made computationally effective.
In the 80 years since the inception of this method many variants have been introduced which apply more generally or give stronger results.

We will give a guided tour of the method of Chabauty, its extensions and some of its many applications within arithmetic geometry.
This will include, the original method of Chabauty, number field Chabauty, elliptic curve Chabauty, Chabauty--Kim and quadratic Chabauty.
