## This talk

I'll report on two projects

### Formalization of the integer solutions of some Mordell equations $$y^2 = x^3 - k$$
CPP 2023

and 

### A formal implementation of Tate's algorithm
(forthcoming)

both projects in algebraic number theory / arithmetic geometry

Note:

Formalization of mathematics to progress it needs to become easier to write specialized tactics

---
<!-- .slide: class="two-floating-elements" -->
## Project 1: Class groups and Diophantine equations
**Goal:** Formalize more modern (20th century) work in number theory and arithmetic geometry, such as solving:

What are the integer solutions $x,y \in \mathbf Z$ of 
$$y^2 = x^3 - 13\\,?$$

```lean
theorem Mordell_minus13 (x y : ℤ) (h : y^2 = x^3 - 13) : (x, y) = (17, 70) ∨ (x, y) = (17, -70) := ...
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

These types of problems are known as *Diophantine equations*.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* This class of problem is still an active area of research, e.g.
  $$x^2 + y^3 = z^5$$
  has not been resolved
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* In general the problem is known to be undecidable.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* There is a zoo of equations out there, and many techniques known, the field often makes progress case by case
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* We formalize a technique for solving some such equations, using number fields and the class group in ~6000 lines (Lean)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Why, do this to see whats possible? what automation is needed

### Classical number theory tools

**Congruences (Ancient, modern form due to Euler/Gauss 1750-1850)**
$$2y^2 = 4x^3 - 13$$
has no integer solutions, as the LHS is even and the RHS is odd.
<!-- .element: class="colorbox" -->

**Descent (Ancient, used heavily by Fermat, 1600s)**
$$y^2 = 2x^2$$
has no (nonzero) integer solutions, as given a solution $(x,y)$ we can show that $(x/2, y/2)$ is also an integer solution, so there cannot be a smallest one (except $(0,0)$).
<!-- .element: class="colorbox fragment" -->

**Quadratic Reciprocity (Gauss, ~1800)**
$$2y^2 =x ^ 4- 41z^4$$
has 1 solution with $x=y=z=0$, otherwise:
if $q \mid y$ then 41 is a square modulo $q$, this implies that $y$ is a square modulo 41
so that 2 is a 4th power mod 41 (QR), but this is false!
<!-- .element: class="colorbox fragment" -->

Note:
such things are taught in a first course in number theory

---
### Using these sort of techniques

Laurent Thery, [2004](https://github.com/coq-contribs/sum-of-two-square) in Coq:
$$x^2 + y^2 = p$$
has a solution for all primes $p$ that are 1 mod 4.
<!-- .element: class="colorbox" -->

Delahaye, Mayero, [2005](https://hal.science/hal-00009425), in Coq:
$$x^4 + y^4 = z^4$$
have no solutions in the non-zero integers.
Also  solve $$x^2 + y^ 2 = z^ 2\text{ and }xy = 2t^2.$$
<!-- .element: class="colorbox fragment" -->

Oosterhuis, [2007](https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/8392/), in Isabelle:
$$x^2 + 3y^2 = p$$
has a solution for all primes $p$ that are 1 mod 3 (also 1 mod 4 result),
also non-existence of solutions to
$$x^3 + y^3 = z^3 \text{ and } x^4 + y^4 = z^4.$$
<!-- .element: class="colorbox fragment" -->

Note:
Also stuff in leans mathlib
Might ask what are all these mathematicians who suddenly started learning lean doing? Just repeating 15-20 year old work from other provers?

Lots of other NT out there of many flavours, this is only diophantine equations

## Why is $y^2 = x^3 - 13$ harder?

- Diophantine equations of two variables define curves geometrically
- The genus ($\ge0$) of a curve determines the difficulty, generally the genus increases with the degree of the polynomial
- As soon as the genus $\ge 1$ we have a finite set of integral points
- The curves we look at have genus = 1, some of these have finitely many rational solutions, some infinitely many
- The curve $y^2 = x^3 - 13$ has infinitely many rational points

![collatz](curve.gif)<!-- .element style="display: inline-block; width: 50%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->
---
This type of equation is known as a *Mordell equation*, studied by mordell in early 1900s,
![mordell](mordell.png) <!-- .element style="display: inline-block; width: 65%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->

Note:
One reason, the solutions are bigger than the coefficients so any congruences are unlikely to pick them out
---
# The argument
If $x,y$ satisfy $y^2 = x^3 - 13$ then $(y + \sqrt{-13})(y - \sqrt{-13}) = x^3$, we can check that

$$y + \sqrt{-13} \text{ and }y - \sqrt{-13} \text{ are coprime.}$$

*If* this implies that
$$y + \sqrt{-13} \text{ and }y - \sqrt{-13} \text{ are both cubes}$$
then we can conclude that
$$y + \sqrt{-13} = (a + b \sqrt{-13})^3$$
$$ = (a^3 - 39 ab^2) + (3a^2b - 13b^3)\sqrt{-13} $$
$$ = a(a^2 - 39 b^2) + b(3a^2 - 13b^2)\sqrt{-13} $$
$$ \implies b = \pm 1$$
$$\implies 1 = \pm(3a^2 - 13)$$ $$ \implies a = \pm 2, b=-1 \implies y = \pm70, x=17 $$
---

## When do cubes only factor into cubes?

In the integers it is almost true that if
$$x,y \text{ are coprime  and }xy = z^n$$
then there are some $x',y'$ such that
$$x = x'^n,\\,y = y'^n$$
the only issue is $\pm1$.

$$(-4)(-9) = 36 = 6^2$$
but neither $-4$, $-9$, is literally a square.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

In number rings we also have issues: Observe that
$$(6 + \sqrt{-13}) (2 - 3 \sqrt{-13}) = 51 - 16\sqrt{-13} = (8 - \sqrt{-13})^2$$
but  $6 + \sqrt{-13}$ and $2 - 3 \sqrt{-13}$ are coprime but both are not squares in $\mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{-13}]$!
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

---

## When do cubes only factor into cubes?

Problem: When does $$r \cdot s = t ^ 3 \implies r = t_1^3 \text{ and } s = t_2^3?$$ in a number ring
<!-- .element: class="colorbox" -->

The theory of class groups of number fields is a key concept in number theory, it controls this sort of factorization.
For a number field $K$ the definition of the **ideal class group** is
$$\operatorname{Cl}(K) := \\{I \text{ nonzero ideal of }\mathcal O_K\\}/ I \sim J \iff xI = yJ \text{ for some } x,y \in \mathcal O_K$$

this forms a group under multiplication of ideals, elements are called **ideal classes**.

Here every principal ideal is equivalent to the ideal $(1)$ (and this is an iff).

The advantage of using ideals instead of elements is that we have an analogue of unique factorization into primes for ideals of a Dedekind domain.

In the previous example:
$$(6 + \sqrt{-13}) (2 - 3 \sqrt{-13}) = (8 - \sqrt{-13})^2$$
this factors on the level of ideals as 
$$(7, 6 + \sqrt{-13})^2 (11, 2 - 3 \sqrt{-13})^2 = (8 - \sqrt{-13})^2 = (7, 6 + \sqrt{-13})^2 (11, 2 - 3 \sqrt{-13})^2$$

But the ideals $(7, 6 + \sqrt{-13}), (11, 2 - 3 \sqrt{-13})$ are non-principal, non-trivial in the class group.
---
## Using the class group

The upshot of this is that we have a finite abelian group $\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ such that

$$\gcd (n , \\#\operatorname{Cl}(K))=1  \implies \exists u,v\in \mathcal O_K^\times, r \cdot s = t ^ n \implies r = u t_1^n \text{ and } s = v t_2^n$$ 

If we can compute the class group and the unit group (modulo $n$th powers) explicitly we can push the previous proof through.

The definition of, and finite abelian group structure of the class group was formalized in Lean by Baanen, Dahmen, Ashvni (Narayanan), Nuccio [2021](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/13900/). 


Note that the definition is inherently noncomputable, without a given set of a generators there is no guarentee that all elements have been found.
Checking that elements are non-trivial is also hard (and an interesting problem to try and certify), but at worst only makes your life harder later.

The unit group in the case of $\mathbf Q(\sqrt{-d})$ is fairly easy to calculate, using the norm, in all cases it has order a power of 2, so doesn't impact whether things are cubes or not.

---
## Proof versus calculation

Often proofs require explicit *calculation*
one can also state general results, but number theorists are interested in classifying single cases,
does it ever happen that the difference between the area of an integer sided square and the volume of an integer sided cube equals 13?

| General / conceptual | Specific / calculational |
|---------|---|
| All equations $y^2 = x^3 + d$ have finitely many solutions | The solutions of $y^2 = x^3 - 13$ have $x=17$|
| There is a bound on the norm of a generator of an element of a class group | Every element of the class group of $\mathbf Q(\sqrt{-13})$ contains the integer 12 |
| All class groups of number fields are finite | The class group of $\mathbf Q(\sqrt{-13})$ is $\mathbf Z / 2$ |
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:
Also need to worry about units
on LHS bound doesn't matter, can be huge but finite
for rhs need good bounds, when proving need even better than  for a CAS
---
# Bounding class groups

Need to calculate the size of the class group, to check that it is not divisible by 3

Do this in two steps, bounding/listing the possible generators, and checking their order/relations.

Given a list of possible generators we can calculate the full group by checking whether various combinations of the generators are trivial or not.

Verifying that a particular ideal is trivial in the class group is easy, just exhibit a single generator.

To show that an ideal is not principal we make use of the norm, if an ideal $I = (x)$ then $\operatorname{Nm}(I) = \operatorname{Nm}(x)$, so if there are no solutions $x$ to this equation the ideal is not principal.
In our case this comes down to solving things like:

$$x^2 + 13 y^2 = 2$$
which can be resolved via elementary methods.

---
## The usual bound
*Theorem (Minkowski)*: Every class in the ideal class group of $K$ contains an integral ideal of norm not exceeding Minkowski's bound

$$M_{K}={\sqrt  {|D|}}\left({\frac  {4}{\pi }}\right)^{{r_{2}}}{\frac  {n!}{n^{n}}}$$

the key ingredient of this theorem is Minkowski's (fundamental) theorem, on lattice vectors inside convex symmetric bodies:

![minko](minko.gif) <!-- .element style="display: block; width: 40%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->

This ingredient has been formalized in Isabelle + other HOL style proof assistants, and also in Lean!

But the proof still involves a bit of work, and a lower tech result gives something more useful in our case.

---
## The method we use

We actually compute these groups for a handful of quadratic fields fully, which is of independent interest, we use:

```
theorem exists_mk0_eq_mk0' [is_dedekind_domain S] (I : (ideal S)⁰) (M : finset R) (hM : ∀ m ∈ M, algebra_map R S m ≠ 0)
  (hex : ∀ (a : S) {b : S}, b ≠ 0 → (∃ (q : S) (r : R) (H : r ∈ M),
              abv (algebra.norm R (r • a - q * b)) < abv (algebra.norm R b))) :
  ∃ (J : (ideal S)⁰), class_group.mk0 I = class_group.mk0 J ∧ algebra_map _ _ (∏ m in M, m) ∈ (J : ideal S) := ...
```
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

If you can find a set of denominators $\\{d_i\\}$ such that every element of the number field has difference from some other element with denominator in $\\{d_i\\}$ of norm less than $1$ then every element of the class group contains $\prod_{i} d_i$.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
This reduces the problem of finding generators of the class group to that of covering the number field by lattice centered "balls"
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

![collatz](1.gif)<!-- .element class="fragment" style="display: inline-block; width: 32%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->
![collatz](2.gif)<!-- .element class="fragment" style="display: inline-block; width: 32%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->
![collatz](3.gif)<!-- .element class="fragment" style="display: inline-block; width: 32%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->


Note:
not aware of a specific statement of this in the literature but is quite related to several existing notions
main benefit is ease of formalization, a sometimes orthogonal axis
would be interesting to compare this with existing bounds

# Calculational tactics

We need to do lots of calculations in rings like $\mathbf Z [\sqrt{-13}]$ (but also aim at more general examples like $\mathbf Z [\sqrt[3]{2}]$)

Want to explicitly evaluate expressions like $(1 + \sqrt{-13}) (2 - 2 \sqrt{-13})$ at many points in the proof and calculation of class (and unit) groups.

- <!-- .element class="fragment" --> One way: expand and use the simplifier to reduce high powers that can be expressed with expressions with smaller exponents

- <!-- .element class="fragment" --> Our initial approach: use a custom type for quadratic rings $R[\alpha]$ ($\alpha^2 + m \alpha + n = 0$), represented as (named) pairs $(a,b) = a + b \alpha$.  Then extensionality and simplification reduces to goals over the integers

- <!-- .element class="fragment" --> Something more versatile: Rings like $\mathbf Z [\sqrt{-13}]$ are additively isomorphic to $\mathbf Z^2$, but with a multiplication that sends
  $$(0,1)^2 = (-13,0)$$
  As the multiplication is linear we can define it via a matrix on the standard basis (the times table of the ring).
  We introduce a tactic that uses the times table to do explicit calculations quickly
```lean
example (a b c d : ℤ) : (a + b * √2 + c * √3 + d * √2 * √3 : sqrt_2_sqrt_3) *
                          (a - b * √2 + c * √3 - d * √2 * √3 : sqrt_2_sqrt_3) *
                          (a + b * √2 - c * √3 - d * √2 * √3 : sqrt_2_sqrt_3) *
                          (a - b * √2 - c * √3 + d * √2 * √3 : sqrt_2_sqrt_3) =
    a^4 - 4*a^2*b^2 + 4*b^4 - 6*a^2*c^2 - 12*b^2*c^2 + 9*c^4 + 48*a*b*c*d - 12*a^2*d^2 - 24*b^2*d^2 - 36*c^2*d^2 + 36*d^4 :=
begin
    apply sqrt_2_sqrt_3.times_table.ext (λ k, _),
    fin_cases k; times_table,
end
```

# Connection to computer algebra systems
 
Have been considered (often) before
- Harrison-Théry 1997, HOL + Maple

- Lewis-Wu 2021, Lean + Mathematica

We propose a prototypical link from Lean to SageMath (free OSS)

This is designed to be robust, connecting to Sage on the user's computer or via the web (c.f. polyrith)

Rather than ad hoc we want a system that can be extended in future with less effort (meta-meta-programming).

We can use this to implement tactics to prove ideal equalities and to factor ideals and polynomials, that call Sage to do some calcuations whose results are then verified.

```
meta def replace_certified_sage_equality
    (matcher : expr → tactic bool)
    (reify_type : Type∗ )
    (reify : expr → tactic reify_type)
    (sage_input : reify_type → tactic string)
    (output_type : Type∗ )
    [has_from_sage output_type]
    (convert_output : output_type → tactic expr)
    (validator : expr → expr → tactic expr)
    (name : string)

## Project 2: Tate's Algorithm

With Sacha Huriot-Tattegrain and Sander Dahmen

Tate's algorithm concerns, elliptic curves:
$$y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6$$
with coefficients in a discrete valuation ring ($v(ab) = v(a) + v(b), v(a+b) \ge \max(v(a), v(b))$)

It essentially computes invariants of a nice scheme theoretic model of the curve.

Much of the work involves making changes of variables $(x,y)\mapsto(ux + r, uy + sx + t)$ to ensure that the coefficients $a_i$ (or various polynomials in them $b_2,b_4,b_6,b_8$ and $c_4,c_6$) have sufficiently high valuation.



Tate's algorithm:

- is recursive
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->10 main steps 
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->one recursive subprocedure
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->explained over 5 pages originally by Tate, in a nice style (but with some details skipped!)
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->mostly solved the original problem, but variants are still proposed and explored in modern research, 
  including generalizations to higher genus curves ($y^2 = f(x)$) which are an order of magnitude more complex again
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<https://wstein.org/Tables/antwerp/tate/tate.pdf#page=14>
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
---
## Motivation

- Bridging the gap between ITPs and computer algebra

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Checking how fast Lean 4 compiled code can be on a complex mathematical algorithm
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Implementing a very generic version of the algorithm, with assumptions clearly stated
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Validating properties of the algorithm / quantities computed, e.g.
Papadopoulos I.  Sur la classification de Néron des courbes elliptiques en caractéristique résiduelle 2 et 3
![pap](pap1.png) <!-- .element style="display: inline-block; width: 65%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;" -->

---

![pap](pap2.png)<!-- .element class="fragment" style="display: inline-block; width: 45%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:0;margin-bot:0;float:right;" -->

The tables of results go on for several pages, and the proofs many more (34 pages in the published version)

The contents of these tables is used in current research and proofs surrounding the generalized Fermat equation.

This is the sort of mathematics that formalization may actually make clearer, detailed analysis of the behaviour of a complicated procedure under different assumptions on the input.

Note:
Tate's algo extended to non-perfect residue field, more Kodaira types, what is analogue of Pap?

---
## What does it mean to formalize an algorithm?

- The gold standard is to implement an algorithm in a proof assistant and prove it computes the same function as a natural "mathematical" definition in the system (we do not do this)

- Another possibility is simply to implement the algorithm as described in a paper, and verify that its properties agree with what is claimed in theory. Here we use the algorithm itself as the definition of the function that it computes.

By implementing the algorithm in a descriptive, rather than low level way we still gain some confidence in correctness.
We can prove substeps and transformation rules are correct.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
By verifying enough properties the algorithm can sometimes be seen, on paper, to actually implement the desired function, even before the actual definition can be formalized.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->


---
## Results of the formalization project


We have formalized two versions of the algorithm:
- an initial version over the integers, covering the most common application
- a general version over an arbitrary ring with discrete valuation and some chosen functions to reduce valuations and pick small representatives for the residue ring

Both are fast enough to run in practice (even without lots of optimization)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
The project began with Sacha's internship at the VU ~1.5 years ago, so we were early users of Lean 4.
Several bugs in Lean4/Mathlib4 tactics and interfaces found and many fixed, and even a very subtle one in the compiler core were discovered (hit in 0.0000001% of examples). 
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Current goals:
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Working on finishing some small subproofs along the way (porting from mathlib 3->4) 

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Working on implementing other rings where we can run the algorithm (e.g. number fields, function fields).
  This may be the first ever implementation of the algorithm that runs on such rings

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Verifying more properties of the algorithm such as invariance under isomorphic input models

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Verifying some versions of the above tables

---
## Challenges faced

The algorithm itself is long and complicated in the geneneral case, proof of termination is via an a priori bounded quantity that increases every time the subprocedure runs twice.

Many goals combining known inequalities on valuations of our invaraints to obtain new ones
```
R: Type u
inst✝: CommRing R
inst: IsDomain R
p: R
evr: EnatValRing p
e: Model R
h1: v evr.valtn e.a1 ≥ 1
h2: v evr.valtn e.a2 ≥ 2
⊢ v evr.valtn (e.a1 * e.a1 + 4 * e.a2) ≥ 2
```

In order to formalize this cleanly we need specific api around, as well as decision procedures for the ordered semiring $ℕ∪∞$

We simply do cases on each variable, simplifying inequalities that contain infinity to simpler statements and recursing, eventually reching a state where existing automation applies.<br />
This still requires a non-trivial implementation to get this right.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
Alternative approach using metavariables and Aesop was also promising.

More generally there is in fact: Effective Quantifier Elimination for Presburger Arithmetic with Infinity, Aless Lasaruk and Thomas Sturm 
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
Similarly we would benefit from a tactic for working with ring expressions modulo $p$ or modulo given relations.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
We still did a lot of experimentation and copy-pasting with computer algebra systems to write down the necessary transformations in general.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->
Thesis: more meta-meta-programming needed to make it easier for the formalizer to implement such tactics.

## Verification of some data in the LMFDB

- The LMFDB is a large online database and website hosting data relevant to number theorists, such as number fields, elliptic and genus 2 curves, L-functions, modular forms, groups, abelian varieties, Artin representations, local fields, ...

<http://lmfdb.xyz/EllipticCurve/Q/14/a/1>

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Data is often ordered by some natural invariants, and complete up to a certain bound.

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Correctness and completeness is paramount, and strived for at all times, data added is often computed by independent implementations for cross checking, at for some of the data.

- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Using either of our implementations we can confirm all 13,178,234 entries of local data for 3,824,372 elliptic curves over $\mathbf Q$ currently in the LMFDB.


- <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Next, elliptic curves over number fields!
