motivation: not checking some exceptionally hard piece

area of explicit diophantine geometry

role of computations even within proofs


first mathematical definition of class class group is sort of noncomputable, an infinitely generated group quotiented by a non-obvious equivalence relation

tate's algorithm


can be seen as a complicated mathematical definition or a nontrivial calculation

tools needed, complicated algebraic manipulations
passing from 0 char to  > 0 char to 

variable index implicitly determines how it scales with p

decidability and the elinarith
