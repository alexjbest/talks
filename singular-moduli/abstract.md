Singular Moduli
===============

Singular moduli is the name given to certain special values of a very special function (the j-invariant). These values were studied by number theorists in the 19th century and many thought the story was complete, until more new properties of these values were discovered in the early 80's. In this talk we'll look initially at the classical theory of singular moduli, how they relate to class field theory and how we can use them to explain some striking arithmetic equalities. After this I'll try to provide an overview of some more recent work concerning singular moduli such as Gross and Zagier's work on factoring their differences.
