Riemann Hypotheses
==================

The Riemann hypothesis is a well known conjecture in analytic number theory that describes the behaviour of the Riemann zeta function.
The hypothesis itself has many implications within number theory particularly concerning the structure of the prime numbers.
There are a host of other functions that look like the Riemann zeta that appear all over mathematics and many of these have similar behaviour to the Riemann zeta.
In this talk we will not only look at the Riemann hypotheis but also analogous statements for other zeta functions.
Many of these other hypotheses have been solved completely and in some cases the truth of the hypothesis gives us interesting information about the objects in question.

Along the way we will see optimal communications networks, fractals, surfaces and of course some number theory.
