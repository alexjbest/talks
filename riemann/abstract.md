Riemann Hypotheses
==================

The Riemann hypothesis is a well known conjecture in analytic number theory that describes the behaviour of the Riemann zeta function.
The hypothesis itself has many implications within number theory particularly concerning the structure of the prime numbers.
However there are a host of other functions that are defined in a similar way to Riemann zeta appearing all over mathematics and many of these have similar behaviour to the Riemann zeta.
In this talk we will look both at the original Riemann hypothesis and the implications of analogous statements for other zeta functions.
Many of these other hypotheses have been solved completely and their validity (or invalidity) often gives us interesting information about the objects in question.

Along the way we will see some optimal communications networks, fractals, surfaces and of course some number theory.
