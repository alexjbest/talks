\section{The original hypothesis}

\begin{frame}{The Riemann zeta function: Euler's work}
\begin{itemize}
\item In 1735 Euler solves the \emph{Basel problem} by finding that
\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.\]
\pause \item He also discovered more general formulae for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-2k}$ in terms of the Bernoulli numbers $B_{2k}$ for all natural $k$.
\note{nowadays we see this as evaluating $\zeta(2)$.}
\pause \item In fact, a nice form for \[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-2k-1},\] is still unknown today.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Riemann zeta function: Along comes Riemann}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.575\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item In 1859 Bernhard Riemann, a well known analyst, publishes a paper on his work counting the primes using analysis.
\item<2-> In the paper he considers
\[
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}.
\]
\note{this is the only paper on number theory he every publishes, a thankyou to the berlin academy for accepting him as a corresponding member, miracle he published it all given its sketchy nature he rarely published unpolished work}
\item<3-> Here the notation $\zeta$ for this function is used for the first time.
\item<4-> Along the way he (essentially) makes four hypotheses.
\note{these are not the hypotheses we are going to talk about, bar one, which we will get to in a minute. Riemann himself disregarded the hypothesis and seemingly barely did any work on it after the paper was published.}

\begin{frame}{The Riemann zeta function: What Riemann did}
Already Euler had (more or less) noticed that 
\[\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-p^s}.\]
\pause In his paper Riemann uses this to take the function $\zeta\colon \{\sigma + it \in\mathbb{C}\mid \sigma > 1\} \to \mathbb{C}$ and extend it to all of $\mathbb{C}$.
\pause He defines an analytic function from $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ which matches the series definition given above when the series converges (when $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$).
\pause Riemann also discovers a \emph{functional equation} for the zeta function by showing that
\[ \frac{1}{\pi^{s/2}} \Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{\pi^{(1-s)/2}} \Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) \zeta(1-s).\]
\note{details of this aren't important to us, but this sort of self similarity is a feature in common of many of the functions we will meet.}

\section{Zeta functions for graphs}
\note{now time for something completely different, the links should become clear shortly.}

\begin{frame}{Ramanujan graphs}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.618\textwidth}

Suppose we want to design a communications network (for computers, people, phones, etc.) by linking together $n$ entities with wires, such that each object has only $k$ wires from it.

\pause We shall call our entities \emph{nodes} and wires \emph{edges}, as in graph theory.

\note{There are several properties of such a network we could want}
\pause For today we will think of our goal as the following:

If we split our network into two nonempty parts (a partition) there should be lots of edges between the two halves. \note{so lots of messages can get through simultaneously}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{.3819\textwidth}

\tikzstyle{every node}=[circle, draw, fill=black!50,
                        inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt]
\pause
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick,scale=0.775]%
        \draw (0,0) node{} -- (1,1) node{} -- (2,0) node{}
 -- (3,0) node{} -- (4,1) node{} -- (5,0) node{} -- (4,-1) node{}
 -- (4,0) node{} -- (5,0) node{} -- (4,1) node{} -- (4,0) node{}
 -- (4,-1) node{} -- (3,0) node{} -- (2,0) node{} -- (1,-1) node{}
 -- (1,0) node{} -- (1,1) node{} -- (0,0) node{} -- (1,0) node{}
 -- (1,-1) node{} -- (0,0) node{};
\end{tikzpicture}
\pause
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick,scale=0.5]%
    \draw \foreach \x in {18,90,...,306} {
        (\x:4) node{} -- (\x+72:4)
        (\x:4) -- (\x:3) node{}
        (\x:3) -- (\x+15:2) node{}
        (\x:3) -- (\x-15:2) node{}
        (\x+15:2) -- (\x+144-15:2)
        (\x-15:2) -- (\x+144+15:2)
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\note{many applications in CS of course, and not just practical network stuff more theoretical ideas too, recently (~10 years) these ideas have found more uses within mathematics.}

\section[Number theory again]{Back to number theory}
\note{didn't want to talk about number theory so much as I wanted to focus more on why you might care about zeta functions even if you don't care about the structure of the primes.}
\begin{frame}{The Dedekind zeta function}
Richard Dedekind (1831--1916) wanted to use analysis to study more general fields called number fields.

\pause \begin{block}{Number fields}
A \emph{number field} is a field that is also a finite dimensional $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space.
\end{block}

\pause e.g. $\{a+bi\mid a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}$, \pause $\{a+b\sqrt{2}\mid a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}$, \pause $\{a+b\sqrt{2} +c\sqrt{3}+d\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}\mid a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Q}\}$.

\pause In a general number field the idea of a prime element doesn't work out so well, however if we consider nice subgroups of the field (ideals) then everything works out well, so we should deal with ideals instead of elements!
\pause For example we  have unique factorisation of ideals into prime ideals.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Dedekind zeta function}
So Dedekind defined for a number field $K$
\begin{block}{The Dedekind zeta function}\note{what do we want to write here}
\[\zeta_K(s) = \pause \sum_{I\subset \mathcal{O}_K} \frac{1}{N(I)^s}\]
where $N(I)$ is the \emph{norm} of $I$ (its size).
\end{block}
\pause $\mathbb{Q}$ is a number field too, and it turns out that the ideals of $\mathbb{Q}$ correspond one to one with the set of natural numbers!
We also have that the norm for these ideals is simply the natural number they correspond to.
\pause Therefore
\[\zeta(s) = \zeta_\mathbb{Q}(s)\]
and the Dedekind zeta is a direct generalisation of our original zeta.
\pause The analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for the Dedekind zeta is very direct, 
\pause The similarities don't end there, a proof of these hypotheses for all number fields (known as the \emph{extended} Riemann hypothesis would asymptotically tell us about the number of prime ideals of bounded norm, exactly the same as for the natural primes.
\note{in fact we have an Euler product for this function too! and of course its RH tells us about the primes of the number field. don't get into as not so many people know ant!}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Closing remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Zeta functions can be used to pack up lots of useful information into one big package (a complex function).
\pause\item The properties of this package can tell us about the objects we started with.
\pause\item We can also see links between different objects via their zeta functions.
\pause\item Due to the abundant computational evidence (over ten trillion non-trivial zeroes found so far, all on the critical line) a huge number of papers have been written that assume the Riemann hypothesis is true.
So a proof of the (generalised) hypothesis would imply hundreds of other results true also.
