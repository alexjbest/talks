Computing Coleman integrals on superelliptic curves
===================================================

Coleman integration is a $p$-adic integration theory that may be applied to integrate 1-forms on curves.
In this lightning talk we discuss recent work to develop algorithms to compute these integrals specifically on superelliptic curves.
This technique provides a quick way to find and verify torsion points on the Jacobians of such curves.
