Zeta functions and $p$-adic integrals; computations and applications
====================================================================

Given an algebraic curve we can construct its zeta function over a finite field.
What does it know about the curve? How can we compute it for a given curve?
In this talk we will look at ways of computing the zeta function (fast!), and related invariants.
We will also consider a $p$-adic integration theory, which is surprisingly related to the zeta function, and ask what it can tell us about the curve and its Jacobian.
